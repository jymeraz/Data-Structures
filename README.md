Advances course of data structures

Lab1: Implement different operations through loops and slicing independently in order to analyze and gain a better understanding of the relative efficiency of both methods to deal with arrays.

Lab2: Implement different algorithms to sort Lists and evaluate their respective running times with different inputs. The different inputs include sorted and unsorted Lists of differing sizes.

Lab3: Implement bst sort and btree sort algorithms to sort Lists and evaluate their respective running times against other sorting algorithms. The different inputs include sorted and unsorted Lists of differing sizes. 

Lab4: Implement a hash table and binary search tree in order to retrieve all the anagrams of a large set of English words. In addition, discuss the statistics and performance of each method.

Lab5: Implement graph algorithms in order to solve problems for real life examples using text files as a data source. The graph algorithms include graph dearch algorithms and minimum spanning tree algorithms.

Lab6: Implement dynamic programming to determine the similarity of protein sequences. In addition, edit the given dynamic programming function by choosing the neighbor that maximizes the similarity value influenced by the given blosum matrix.

Additional work in recursion, linked lists, binary search trees, B-trees, hash tables, heaps, graphs, and dynamic programming are included.
